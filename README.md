# Salesforce-Smart-BioTech
Biotech labs and genetic testing firms handle thousands of daily requests from hospitals, clinics, and patients. Manual lead handling, sample tracking, and reporting cause delays and compliance issues. A Salesforce CRM will automate workflows with AI, IoT, and blockchain for secure, efficient, and transparent operations.

Problem Statement
 Biotech labs and genetic testing companies face thousands of requests daily from hospitals, clinics,
